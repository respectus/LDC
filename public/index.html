     * LogDNA Challenge - by Muaz
     <br>
     *    A basic text to JSON parser accessed through a simple REST API.
     <br>
     *    Makes use of Parsing Expression Grammar to implement the given search rules.
     <br>
     *    Search Rules:
     <br>
     * &nbsp;&nbsp;     - terms are implicitly AND'd together unless quoted
     <br>
     * &nbsp;&nbsp;       - terms are implicitly an exact match
     <br>
     * &nbsp;&nbsp;       - multiple search terms can be nested using ()'s
     <br>
     * &nbsp;&nbsp;       - negation can be done using ! in front of search term
     <br>
     *  &nbsp;&nbsp;      - OR'ing search terms can be done by explicitly using "OR" keyword
     <br>
     *  &nbsp;&nbsp;      - AND'ing search terms can optionally be done by explicitly using "AND" keyword
     <br>
     *  &nbsp;&nbsp;      - using '>', '>=', '<', '=<' denotes a non exact match on the term following respective symbol
     <br>
     *  &nbsp;&nbsp;      - using '=' denotes an exact match on the term following respective symbol
     <br>
     *  &nbsp;&nbsp;      - len(#) will allow us to match length of JSON data instead of actual value
     <br>
     *  &nbsp;&nbsp;      - 'true', 'false' will be matched to their boolean values instead of string values
     <br>
     *
     <br>
     *    Typically a GET request is issued for searches, but in this case there are no constraints
     <br>
     *    given on the length of the search query or the symbols used, therefore I have chosen to use a POST
     <br>
     *    request.
     <br>
     *
     <br>
     *    API can be accessed at http://ldchallenge-muaz.herokuapp.com/jsonify  the plain text query should
     <br>
     *    be passed in with the POST request as the query parameter. Demonstrated in check.js
